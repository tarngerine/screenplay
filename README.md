# Screenplay

The most important parts of software design is done in words: defining goals, setting context, evaluating different options and tradeoffs. Yet mainstream design tools all rely on point-and-click drawing in a spatial canvas.

Screenplay is a software design tool for designing with words.

- Collaborative block-based notebook
- Built-in layouts for comparing and evaluating options
- First-class support for Symaphore, a language for describing user interfaces where you work with words and symbols, not pixels or vectors
- Keyboard-first interface
